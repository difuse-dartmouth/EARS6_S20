# Environmental Change Data Science Module

This folder contains all the components of the data science module for Dartmouth College's Earth Sciences 6: Environmental Change.

## Primary Objective

Through this project, the students will have the opportunity to measure environmental change. Students will also be exposed to temperature and insolation related public datasets. The project is appropriate for courses in introductory environmental sciences, earth sciences, and any other courses related to the climate. It is designed to be done on studentsâ€™ own time outside of the classroom throughout the course of a term or semester. There is an option to use one class time to show video abstracts that students will have created by the end.  

## Student Expectations

For this project, it is expected that the students have familiarity with terms associated with the environment and climate. If not, some lecture time should be taken to establish knowledge of determinants of climate and weather. It will also be beneficial if the students have prior knowledge of the scientific method as they will be exercising it throughout the project. 


## Learning Objectives 
By completing this term project, you will:
1.	Make actual measurements of current environmental change
2.	Estimate the uncertainty associated with your measurements
3.	Formulate a hypothesis as to the nature of the change
4.	Test a hypothesis
5.	Draw conclusions
6.	Collaborate with fellow students to share data, work, and ideas
7.	Communicate your findings in both written and oral form



## Module Outline
1. Students complete a pre-project questionnaire
2. Students work in groups to complete the term project.
3. Students take daily measurements of the incidence angle of the sun to create a data set for analysis which is stored in excel.
4. Students analyze public data on climate and insolation variable.
5. Deliverable: Preliminary data and hypothesis report (1 page)
6. Deliverable: Final Project Report (Manuscript)
7. Deliverable: Video Abstract (1-3 minutes)
8. Deliverable: Reflection (1 paragraph)
